# vite-plugin-wp-component

A **Vite plugin + CLI** for creating, configuring, and deploying WordPress components as reusable plugins.

It allows you to:

- Manage FTP credentials and component metadata.
- Automatically generate the PHP file that registers your component as a WordPress plugin.
- Expose the component configuration as a global variable (`__COMPONENT_CONFIG__`).
- Render your component inside a unique `rootID`, consistent across development and production.
- Deploy directly to your WordPress plugins folder via **FTP**.

## Installation

The recommended way to start is by using **[`wp-create-component`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wp-create-component)**.  
This CLI scaffolds a new project with:

- A preconfigured `vite.config.js`
- `postcss.config.js`
- A demo component template showing how the workflow works
- All required project structure

```bash
npx wp-create-component
```

This is the fastest way to get started and ensures your setup follows the expected structure.

### Manual installation

If you prefer to add the plugin manually to an existing Vite project, you can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install vite-plugin-wp-component --save-dev
```

Once installed you can run `wp-component init`

## CLI

The package installs the `wp-component` command with three main subcommands:

### 1\. `wp-component init`

Creates all the necessary files and structure for the plugin to work:

- Prompts to generate a `component.config.json` file.
- Creates a `.env` file with empty fields (must be later configured using `wp-component config`).
- Creates a `wp-plugin/` directory where the PHP file will be generated.
- Generates a `vite.config.js` file preconfigured with the expected **build settings** and the Vite plugin already set up.
- Generates a `postcss.config.js` file with default settings.

### 2\. `wp-component config`

Opens an interactive selector that allows you to:

- Edit the `.env` file with FTP credentials.
- Edit the `component.config.json` file with your component metadata.

### 3\. `wp-component build`

Generates the WordPress plugin PHP file from a template, injecting values from `component.config.json`.

- The generated file is saved inside the `wp-plugin/` folder.

### 4\. `wp-component deploy`

Reads credentials from `.env` and deploys the plugin via **BasicFTP** to your WordPress installation.

## Configuration

You can edit the following files directly or usin the CLI utility.

### `.env`

You need an `.env` file with your FTP credentials:

```bash
# FTP Credentials
FTP_HOST=ftp.mydomain.com
FTP_USER=username
FTP_PASSWORD=password
FTP_REMOTE_DIR=/public_html/wp-content/plugins
```

⚠️ **Important**:
`FTP_REMOTE_DIR` must point **directly to the WordPress plugins folder**.

---

### `component.config.json`

This file defines your component metadata:

```json
{
  "name": "My Component", // Name displayed in the WP plugins list
  "description": "Description", // Description displayed in WP
  "author": "Your Name", // Author name shown in WP
  "slug": "my-component", // Unique slug, also used to generate the shortcode [my-component]
  "_hash": "abc123" // Auto-regenerated whenever config is edited via CLI, used to generate the rootID.
}
```

## Vite Plugin

In your `vite.config.js` you can register the plugin:

```js
import wpComponentPlugin from "vite-plugin-wp-component";

export default { plugins: [wpComponentPlugin()] };
```

### What does the plugin do?

- Reads configuration from `component.config.json`.
- Exposes the metadata as a global variable:

`__COMPONENT_CONFIG__ // full object with component configuration`

- Dynamically adds a `.rootID` field generated from:

`slug + _hash`

- Cleans the bundle after the build, deleting `index.html` generated by default by `vite` as it is not used in production.

## Using the `rootID`

- In **development** (`vite dev`), the `rootID` is used in `index.html` as the ID of the root element where your component is mounted.
- In **production**, the WordPress shortcode creates an element with the same `rootID`.

It is **critical** to use `__COMPONENT_CONFIG__.rootID` so that both dev and production environments share the exact same element ID.

Example in `index.html`:

```html
<script type="module">
  const root = document.createElement("div");
  root.id = __COMPONENT_CONFIG__.rootID;
  document.body.appendChild(root);
</script>
```

Example in your JS code:

```js
const root = document.getElementById(__COMPONENT_CONFIG__.rootID); // Mount your app/framework here
```

## `wp-component build` Output

When you run `wp-component build`,it generates the necessary PHP bridge inside the `wp-plugin/` directory.

The generated PHP file will:

- **Create a WordPress plugin** using the metadata defined in `component.config.json`.
- **Enqueue the bundled script** (`index.js`) into WordPress. This file contains both the component logic and the CSS styles. In production, styles are injected directly into a `<style>` tag.
- **Register a new shortcode** in WordPress using the `slug` defined in `component.config.json`.  
  When this shortcode is used, it will render the root element with the correct id, where your component is mounted:

```html
<div id="[slug+_hash]"></div>
```

This allows you to drop your component into any WordPress page or post simply by using the shortcode.

## Typical Workflow

1.  Configure credentials and metadata:

    ```
    wp-component config
    ```

2.  Generate the WordPress plugin PHP file:

    ```
    wp-component build
    ```

3.  Deploy to WordPress via FTP:

    ```
    wp-component deploy
    ```
